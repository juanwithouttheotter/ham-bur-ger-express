### Usage
User is able to input a burger of their choice, that burger then is set "to be devoured" where the user can choose to either "send back"(delete) or "devour"(send the burger to the devoured list). From the devoured list user can choose to either "remake" (sends to "to be devoured" list) or "All done" (delete). 

This is an Express app that uses handlebars to do the front end rendering. The backend is created using MySQL in an MVC format.
